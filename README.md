### Visulization of Euclid's GCD using PyOpenGL and Pygame.

## Domain/Subject

Number Theory

## Abstract

Our projects aim at simulating Euclidean's Algorithm with the help of graphical representation(lines).

## Algorithm

We place two numbers side by side and subtract the larger number with the smaller number recursively until we get both numbers equal and then the resultant number is the greatest common divisor of both the numbers.
